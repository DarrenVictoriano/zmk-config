# ZMK Corne Keyboard Layout

This this my personal zmk config, the firmware is built to work with the following devices.

- Keyboard: Corne 6 column
- Controller: nice!nano v2 + nice!view (for both left and right keyboard)
- Dongle: Seed Xiao nRF52840

> This is a dongle setup with zmk studio support. Left and Right keyboard both acts as peripheral and seed xiao as the main controller. This increases the battery life of the left board compared to when it is used as both main and left peripheral.

## Keymaps

These are the keymaps and layers defined in this config.
The keymaps were generated using [Nick Coutsos's Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/).
