# ZMK Corne Keyboard Layout

This this my personal zmk config, the firmware is built to work with the following device.

Keyboard: Corne 6 column
Controller: nice!nano v2 + nice!view (for both left and right keyboard)
Dongle: Seed Xiao nRF52840

> This is a dongle setup with zmk studio support.

## Keymaps

These are the keymaps and layers defined in this config.
The keymaps were generated using [Nick Coutsos's Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/).
